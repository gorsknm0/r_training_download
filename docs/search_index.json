Instead we will guide you through some things that we know and give you a chance to practice. Our aim is for you to feel confident from being able to write one line of code to calling yourself a proper researcher. If you have questions, ask. If you need someone to slow down or say it in a different way, then say so. Because if you’re thinking it, someone else probably is to. So buckle up, and let’s learn how to work with data.

Let’s go. Install R First, let’s get the right programs installed on your computer. Then we will explain what they are and why you need them. First, download and install R: Go to the following website, click the Download button, and follow the website’s instructions from there. https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/ Install RStudio Second, download and install RStudio: Go to the following website and choose the free Desktop version: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Third, make sure RStudio opens successfully: Open the RStudio app. A window should appear that looks like this: Fourth, make sure R is running correctly in the background: In RStudio, in the pane on the left (the “Console”), type 2+2 and hit Enter. If R is working properly, the number “4” will be printed in the next line down. Finally, some minor adjustments to make RStudio run smoother (and look cooler): Go to Tools &gt; Global Options and make sure your General settings match these exactly: Specifically, uncheck the option under Workspace to ‘Restore .RData into workspace at startup.’ Now go to the Appearance settings and choose a cool theme! Boom! You’ve got R up and running. Now it’s time to install some packages. Install packages Packages are what makes R so great. To install a package, open Rstudio, make sure you’re connected to Wi-Fi, and type the following code into the “Console” in the bottom left Did that work? Probably not, because “packagename” is not a real R package. The packages we’ll be using are the following: tidyverse RColorBrewer leaflet ggthemes rmarkdown sp To install all of these, you can run install.packages for each package: install.packages(&#39;tidyverse&#39;) install.packages(&#39;RColorBrewer&#39;) # etc., etc. So, now you’ve got R, RStudio, and some cool packages. Good job. You’re ready for the next module.

You will get a tour of RStudio in the next module. For now, look at the left half of the screen. You should see a large pane entitled the Console. RStudio’s Console is your window into R, the engine under the hood. The Console is where you type commands for R to run, and where R prints back the results of what you have told it to do. Think of the Console as a chatroom, where you and R talk back and forth. 3.1 Running R code in the Console Type your first command into the Console, then press Enter: 1 + 1 [1] 2 When you press Enter, you send your line of code to R; you post it for R to see. Then R takes it, does some processing, and posts a result (2) just below your command. Note that spaces don’t matter. Both of the following two commands are legible to R and return the same thing: 4+4 [1] 8 4 + 4 [1] 8 However, it is better to make your code as easy to read as possible, which usually means using a single space between numbers: 4 + 4 [1] 8 Try typing in other basic calculations: R as a calculator As you can tell from those commands you just ran, R is, at heart, a fancy calculator. Some calculations are straightforward, like addition and subtraction: 490 + 1000 [1] 1490 490 - 1000 [1] -510 Division is pretty straightfoward too: 24 / 2 [1] 12 For multiplication, use an asterisk (*): 24 * 2 [1] 48 You denote exponents like this: 2 ^2 [1] 4 2 ^3 [1] 8 2 ^4 [1] 16 Finally, note that R is fine with negative numbers: 9 + -100 [1] -91 Re-running code If you want to re-run the code you just ran, or if you want to recall the code so that you can adjust it slightly, click anywhere in the Console then press your keyboard’s Up arrow. If you keep pressing your Up arrow, R will present you with sequentially older commands. R keeps a history of everything you have said to it since you opened this window. If you accidentally recalled an old command without meaning to, you can reset the Console’s command line by pressing Escape. Incomplete commands Similar to talking to a friend, if you start a sentence and don’t finish it, your friend will get confused. R gets confused when you enter an incomplete command, and will wait for you to write the remainder of your command on the next line in the Console before doing anything. For example, try running this code in your Console: 45 - You will find that R gives you a little + sign on the line under your command, which means it is waiting for you to complete your command. If you want to complete your command, add a number (e.g., 3) and hit Enter. You should now be given an answer (e.g., 48). Or, if instead you want R to stop waiting and stop running, just press the Escape key. Getting errors R only understands your commands if they follow the rules of the R language (often referred to as its syntax). If R does not understand your code, it will throw an error and give up on trying to execute that line of code. For example, try running this code in your Console: 4 + y You probably received a message in red font stating: Error: object 'y' not found. That is because R did know how to interpret the symbol y in this case, so it just gave up. Get used to errors! They happen all the time, even (especially?) to professionals, and it is essential that you get used to reading your own code to find and fix its errors. Here’s another piece of code that will produce an error: dfjkltr9fitwt985ut9e3 Using parentheses R is usually great about following classic rules for Order of Operations, and you can use parentheses to exert control over that order. For example, these two commands produce different results: 2*7 - 2*5 / 2 [1] 9 (2*7 - 2*5) / 2 [1] 2 Note that parentheses need to come in pairs: whenever you type an open parenthesis, (, eventually you need to provide a corresponding closed parenthesis, ). The following line of code will return a plus sign, +, since R is waiting for you to close the parenthetical before it processes your command: 4 + (5 Remember: parentheses come in pairs! The same goes for other types of brackets: {...} and [...]. You can ask R basic questions using operators. For example, you can ask whether two values are equal to each other. 96 == 95 [1] FALSE 95 + 2 == 95 + 2 [1] TRUE R is telling you that the first statement is FALSE (96 is not, in fact, equal to 95) and that the second statement is TRUE (95 + 2 is, in fact, equal to itself). Note the use of double equal signs here. You must use two of them in order for R to understand that you are asking for this logical test. You can also ask if two values are NOT equal to each other: 96 != 95 [1] TRUE 95 + 2 != 95 + 2 [1] FALSE This test is a bit more difficult to understand: In the first statement, R is telling you that it is TRUE that 96 is different from 95. In the second statement, R is saying that it is FALSE that 95 + 2 is not the same as itself. Note that R lets you write these tests another, even more confusing way: ! 96 == 95 [1] TRUE ! 95 + 2 == 95 + 2 [1] FALSE The first line of code is asking R whether it is not true that 96 and 95 are equal to each other, which is TRUE. The second line of code is asking R whether it is not true that 95 + 2 is the same as itself, which is of course FALSE. Other commonly used operators in R include greater than / less than symbols (&gt; and &lt;, also known as the left-facing alligator and right-facing alligator), and greater/less than or equal to (&gt;= and &lt;=). 100 &gt; 100 [1] FALSE 100 &gt;= 100 [1] TRUE (100 != 100) == FALSE [1] TRUE Use built-in R functions R has some built-in “functions” for common calculations, such as finding square roots and logarithms. Functions are packages of code that take a given value, transform it according to some internal code instructions, and provide an output. You will learn more about functions in a few modules. To find the square-root of a number, use the ‘squirt’ command, sqrt(): sqrt(16) Note the use of parentheses here. When you are calling a function, when you see parentheses, think of the word ‘of’. This line translates to ‘the square root of 16’. You are taking the sqrt of the number inside the parenthetical. To get the log of a value: log(4) Note that the function log() is the natural log function (i.e., the value that e must be raised to in order to equal 4). To calculate a base-10 logarithm, use log10( ). log(10) log10(10) Another handy function is round(), for rounding numbers to a specific number of decimal places. 100/3 round(100/3) round(100/3,digits=1) round(100/3,digits=2) round(100/3,digits=3) Finally, R also comes with some built-in values, such as pi: pi Congratulations!
