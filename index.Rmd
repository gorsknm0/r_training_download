# Welcome to the course!

This won't be your standard classroom course where we formally teach you. Instead we will guide you through some things that we know and give you a chance to practice. Our aim is for you to feel confident from being able to write one line of code to calling yourself a proper researcher. 

If you have questions, ask. If you need someone to slow down or say it in a different way, then say so. Because if you're thinking it, someone else probably is too. 

So buckle up, and let's learn how to work with data.
