This is a bookdown to send to students prior to an R training.

By only sharing this information and not the other sections of the course, it is less likely for the students to be overwhelmed. Also, the students will then be forced to focus in class on what is going on in the course rather than working ahead. But maybe it's not a bad idea for more advanced students to be able to work ahead. Therefore, maybe make a decision on which to do.

It is recommended to translate this into the local language that the training will be taught in.
